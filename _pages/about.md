I am a postdoctoral fellow in the Division of Hematology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. As a stem cell biologist, I am interested in how stem cells balance self-renewal and differentiation, and how this balance becomes perturbed in aging and cancer. My research centers on transcriptomic and epigenomic programs that regulate hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) fate decisions and macrophage self-renewal in the contexts of inflammation and aging.

During my Ph.D. training in Dr. Michael Sieweke’s group at Technische Universität Dresden, I helped establish that alveolar macrophages—a tissue-resident macrophage population in the lung—can undergo extensive self-renewal in culture without losing core cellular identity and can be genetically manipulated using lentiviral vector.

Currently, I am investigating how external inflammatory and age-associated factors influence HSC lineage commitment by integrating multi-omics approaches with bone marrow reconstitution assays. Although I am primarily a wet-lab experimentalist, I also work with scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data to interpret the molecular logic underlying stem and progenitor cell behavior.
