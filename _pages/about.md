I am a postdoctoral fellow in the Division of Hematology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. As a stem cell biologist, I study how stem cells balance self-renewal and differentiation, and how this balance becomes disrupted in aging and cancer. My research focuses on transcriptomic and epigenomic mechanisms that govern hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) fate decisions and macrophage self-renewal during inflammation and aging.

During my Ph.D. training in Dr. Michael Sieweke’s group at Technische Universität Dresden, I contributed to demonstrating that alveolar macrophages—a tissue-resident population in the lung—can undergo extensive self-renewal in culture without losing core cellular identity, and that they can be genetically engineered using lentiviral vectors.

Currently, I am investigating how inflammatory and age-associated external cues shape HSC lineage commitment by integrating single-cell multi-omics (scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq) with bone marrow reconstitution assays. My work is supported by the Maryland Stem Cell Research Fund Postdoctoral Fellowship. Although my primary expertise is in experimental hematology, I also conduct bioinformatic analyses of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq datasets to interpret the molecular programs underlying stem and progenitor cell behavior.
