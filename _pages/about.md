I am a postdoctoral fellow in the Division of Hematology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. As a stem cell biologist, I am intrigued to the process of how stem cells balance self-renewal and differentiation, and when that mechanisms get awry in age-realted degenerative diseases and cancers. My research focuses on transcriptomic and epigenomic mechanisms that govern hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) fate decisions and macrophage self-renewal during inflammation and aging.

During my Ph.D. training in Dr. Michael Sieweke’s group at Technische Universität Dresden, I contributed to demonstrating that alveolar macrophages—a tissue-resident macrophage population in the lung—can undergo extensive self-renewal in culture without losing core cellular identity, and that they can be genetically engineered using lentiviral vectors.

Currently, I am investigating how inflammation and aging shape HSC lineage commitment by integrating single-cell multi-omics (scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq) with bone marrow reconstitution assays. My work is supported by a prestigious postdoctoral fellowship award from the Maryland Stem Cell Research Fund (MSCRF). Although my primary expertise is in experimental hematology, I also conduct bioinformatic analyses of scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq datasets to interpret the molecular programs underlying stem and progenitor cell behavior.
